Compile time:Compile time is when the program is compiled
variable used in compile time is made as static. Value is not easily changeable and if we change need to compile then run.
say 
foat percentage=65.5;



Run time: runtime is when it executes
variable used in compile time is made as dynamic. Value to the variable can be easily changed while pass it as run time arguments.
float percentage=arg[0];
 here arg[0] is the parameter passed to the main methid and used during run time
